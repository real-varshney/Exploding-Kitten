**Tech Stack:**

* Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Material UI
* Backend: Go (Golang)
* Database: Redis

**Getting Started:**

**Prerequisites:**

* Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
* A Go development environment set up ([https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/getting-started](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/getting-started))

**Instructions:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/real-varshney/Exploding-Kitten.git

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   - **Frontend:**

     ```bash
     npm install (or yarn install)
     ```

   - **Backend:**

     ```bash
     cd Server
     go mod download
     ```

3. **Run the Application:**

   - **Frontend (Development):**

     ```bash
     npm start (or yarn start)
     ```
     
     This typically starts the development server at `http://localhost:3000` (or a custom port).

   - **Backend (Development):**

     ```bash
     cd Server
     go run .
     ```

     This usually starts the Go server on a default port (e.g., `:8080`). The specific port may vary depending on your implementation.
